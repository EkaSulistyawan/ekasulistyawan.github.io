# Welcome to my Github Repo!

## About me
For short, call me Eka! This repo will be capturing every step of my journey as a (Biomedical) Engineer. 
I do have interest in Medical Informatics, especially in the field of Data Analytics.
My experience spans from (light) Bioinformatics and (currently towards) Signal+Image processing.

Wish you get a valuable knowledge from my repo!
